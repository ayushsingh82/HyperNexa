What is a ZKPSM?

The Zero-Knowledge Proof System for Smart Contracts is referred to as ZKPSM. It alludes to a cryptographic process that enables one party—the prover—to demonstrate to another—the verifier—that a statement is accurate while withholding any more information that may compromise the statement's veracity. 

Problem:

Development of decentralised apps (dApps) with improved performance and secrecy features is hampered by existing blockchain networks' scalability issues, transactional privacy issues, and inefficiencies in state machine execution. Conventional methods for creating state machines on blockchains frequently depend on transparent execution models that jeopardise user privacy and data confidentiality by making sensitive information visible to all network users. Further impeding the adoption of dApps for practical use cases is the inability of blockchain networks to scale, which results in expensive transaction fees, sluggish transaction processing times, and constrained throughput.

Solution:

We propose the creation of a Zero-Knowledge Provable State Machine (ZKPSM) framework to address the issues of efficiency, privacy, and scalability in blockchain networks. Using the SP1 architecture for hardware-level optimisations, this system incorporates TowerABCL, a high-performance blockchain framework developed in the Rust programming language. The ZKPSM framework efficiently verifies state transitions while guaranteeing the privacy and confidentiality of state machine execution through the use of cutting-edge cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). The ZKPSM framework makes it possible to create scalable, privacy-preserving, and verifiable state machines on blockchain networks by utilising effective hardware architectures and cryptographic primitives. This opens the door for the construction of dApps with improved speed and security features.
